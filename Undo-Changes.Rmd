This is a test document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars} 
library(kableExtra)
summary(cars) %>% 
kbl(caption = "Summary of the Cars dataset") %>% 
kable_classic(full_width = F, html_font = "Cambria", position = "left")  

```

I am going to add some stuff here, then run a revert back to f341889  

OK?
