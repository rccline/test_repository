#### 2. Rebase basics from *Team Programmer* on Youtube. `git rebase origin/master`   

[Team Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkGZzd9c4ow&t=195s) Git rebase basics. 
- This is complicated.  
- `git fetch origin main` to download the main branch with latests commits into your local system.   
- First Rebase on your local system.  
- `git rebase origin/main` 

#### 3. Branching for **`feature development`**. 
  - Strategy to remember what features I am working with.  
  - One strategy:  Name each brach for the file being worked on.
    - E.g.  Branch name is:  `feature/filename`  
    - E.g. `features/new-file2` while developing file named:  *new-file2.R*
  - Second strategy I am exploring is `creating a folder for each feature`, or at least for the features in development.  
  - By using separate folders for feature development, I know the main or master branch is clean.
